          In March 2021, I began experimenting with UI design and became
          interested in UX principles. The placement of UI elements is based on
          research, which sparks my curiosity and inspired me to explore UX
          further.

        To identify potential areas for improvement, I conducted a competitive
        analysis of 11 prominent apartment rental websites before beginning the
        design phase. By taking screenshots and noting common features, I was
        able to observe how competitors solve similar problems. By interacting
        with the websites, I also evaluated potential areas for improvement and
        feature changes.
